## 7. How to run

Download our game from the release section and follow the instrunctions.

Download the [image folder](https://github.com/BarakShachar/OOP-Ex4/tree/main/ex4_java_client/images) for see the animated as shown above in th GIF.

How to rum our algorithm from the CMD:

```bash
java -jar .\Ex4_Server_v0.0.jar <caseID> 
```

and then run the Game data via studentCode:

```cmd
java -jar .\Ex4_v1.0.jar
```

You can also run manually our tests for our algorithm and function in the Tests folder
